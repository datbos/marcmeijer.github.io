description: SFR (Spatial Frequency Response) of a camera is a measure of the sharpness "resolution" that a camera-lens system can resolve for a edge black-white transition. Having digital zoom capability allowed for the camera o be integrated with a bioptic 3D configuration with sob millimeter z resolution. To transition the tele health system from an optical zoom to a digital zoom, the quality of the image cannot be compromised according to ISO12233 standards.
