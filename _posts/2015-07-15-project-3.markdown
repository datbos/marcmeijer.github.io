description: CCR5 is a critical cell surface protein necessary for HIV to enter a cell. The "Berlin patient" was treated with a stem cell therapy including inactive CCR5 and showed complete remission. In an effort to create a therapeutic stem cell CCR5 inactivated library, CRISPR genome editing was used to disable CCR5 and insert a fluorescent protein at mutation site to compare the mechanisms and signal transduction pathways of virus in murine and human models.
